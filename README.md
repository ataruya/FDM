# FDM
## Jupyter Notebook files to reproduce the figures in the paper ###

This package contains the Jupyter Notebook files with which figures presented in the paper, "An analytical approach to core-halo structure of fuzzy dark matter", can be reproduced. 

Requirements: CLASS (CMB Boltzmann code with python wrapper enabled). This is used only in the Core-halo_FDM.ipynb file.


### Core-halo_FDM.ipynb (Figs. 4, 6~9)

This notebook file gives analytical predictions of the soliton core-halo mass relation in the fuzzy dark matter model. Note that this file partly uses the simulation data of Chan et al. ('22) in comparison with analytical results, but it is not currently included.  

### Eigenfunctions.ipynb (Figs. 1~3, 5, 11, 12)

This notebook file computes the eigenfunctions of soliton core that are alytically constructed. For specific examples, computation and results for ell=0, 2, 5, and 10 are presented.

### Impact_self-gravity.ipynb (Fig. 10)

This notebook file presents a perturbative estimation of the impct of the soliton self-gravity that is ignored in the analytical construction of soliton eigenstates on the soliton core-halo mass relation.
