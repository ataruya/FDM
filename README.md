# FDM
## Jupyter Note Book files to reproduce the figures in the paper ###

This package contains the Jupyter Note Book files with which figures presented in the paper, "An analytical approach to core-halo structure of fuzzy dark matter", can be reproduced. 

Requirements: CLASS (CMB Boltzmann code with python wrapper enabled) 

### Core-halo_FDM.ipynb

This notebook file gives analytical predictions of the soliton core-halo mass relation in the fuzzy dark matter model. 

### Eigenfunctions.ipynb

This notebook file computes the eigenfunctions of soliton core that are alytically constructed. For specific examples, computation and results for ell=0, 2, 5, and 10 are presented.

### Impact_self-gravity.ipynb

This notebook file present a perturbative estimation of the impct of the soliton self-gravity that is ignored in the analytical construction of soliton eigenstates on the soliton core-halo mass relation.
